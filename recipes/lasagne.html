    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Little is more satisfying than cooking a classic to perfection – Sarah Cook gives us a lesson in how to make
        lasagne</p>
    <p><strong>Ingredients</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>2 celery sticks</li>
        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>1 carrot</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>140g cubetti di pancetta</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Steps</strong>
    <ol>
        <li>First, make the béchamel sauce. Put the milk, onion, bay leaves and cloves into a large saucepan and bring
            very gently just up to the boil. Turn off the heat and set aside for 1 hr to infuse.</li>
        <li>For the meat sauce, put the oil, celery, onion, carrot, garlic and pancetta in another large saucepan.
            Gently cook together until the veg is soft but not coloured.</li>
        <li> Tip in the beef and pork mince, the milk and chopped tomatoes. Using a wooden spoon, stir together and
            break up and mash the lumps of mince against the sides of the pan. When the mince is mostly broken down,
            stir in all the herbs, the stock cubes and the red wine, and bring to a simmer. Cover and cook for 1 hr,
            stirring occasionally to stop the bottom catching.</li>
    </ol>
